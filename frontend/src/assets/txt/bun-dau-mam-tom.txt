Ingredients for Bun Dau Mam Tom (Vermicelli with Fried Tofu and Shrimp Paste):
500g rice vermicelli (bún lá)
3-5 pieces of tofu
300g deboned pork leg
300g pork belly
300g cha com (young rice pork patties)
50g shrimp paste (mam tom)
3 chili peppers
1 garlic bulb
2 calamondins
1 tablespoon of white wine
Seasonings: sugar, MSG, cooking oil, etc.
Fresh herbs: perilla leaves, mint, coriander, lettuce, cucumber, etc.

Instructions:
Step 1: Boil the Meat
Clean the pork belly and pork leg, blanch them in boiling water to remove impurities, then rinse with fresh water and drain. For extra flavor, marinate the meat with a bit of seasoning for 15-20 minutes. Tie the pork leg with twine to keep it compact, and boil it with a pinch of salt for 25-30 minutes until cooked. Once done, immediately place it in an ice bath to keep the meat firm and crisp.

Step 2: Prepare Fresh Herbs
While the meat is cooking, take the time to prepare the herbs. Remove wilted or damaged leaves, discard stems, and wash thoroughly. Soak the herbs in lightly salted water for 30 minutes, rinse again, and drain. Clean the cucumber, soak in salt water, peel, and slice thinly.

Step 3: Fry the Cha Com
Cha com is a staple in this dish, and a specialty of Hanoi. Heat a pan with oil or fat and fry each cha com piece over medium heat until golden and crispy on both sides. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil.

Step 4: Fry the Tofu
Briefly rinse the tofu under cold water, drain, and cut into bite-sized squares. Heat a pan with oil, then fry the tofu until golden on all sides. Remove and place on a paper towel-lined plate to reduce greasiness, and serve immediately to enjoy the crispy texture.

Step 5: Prepare the Shrimp Paste
Shrimp paste is the soul of this dish, so to make it taste just like in a restaurant, proper mixing is key. Ingredients: 3 tablespoons of high-quality shrimp paste, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 calamondin, 1 fresh chili, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 shallot, and half a tablespoon of white wine.
Mixing instructions: Place the shrimp paste in a small bowl and add calamondin juice, white wine, a tablespoon of oil from frying the tofu, and sugar in the measured amounts. Stir well with chopsticks. When ready to eat, whisk the paste until frothy, then add sliced garlic and chili. Adjust with lime, calamondin, or chili according to taste.

Step 6: Serve
Slice the golden, crispy cha com into long pieces. Cut the vermicelli into small portions. Thinly slice the pork leg and pork belly. Arrange everything on a large bamboo tray or plate, including herbs and the bowl of shrimp paste. Enjoy!
