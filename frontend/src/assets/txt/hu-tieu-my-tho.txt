How to Cook My Tho Rice Noodles
1. Prepare Ingredients: Wash the pork bones. Blanch them briefly in boiling water, then rinse with cold water. Boil the quail eggs, peel them completely. Peel and devein the shrimp, then rinse with salt. Boil the liver until cooked, then slice it thinly. Clean the tenderloin, boil it until cooked, and slice thinly. Wash the celery and cut it into small pieces. Rinse the bean sprouts. Wash the scallions, cut the scallion bulbs into long pieces, and slice the green parts thinly. Slice the chives into long pieces. Peel and clean the white radishes, then cut them into round slices.

2. Cook: Heat oil in a pan and stir-fry the ground pork until it is firm. Add a bit of MSG and fish sauce, stir well, then set aside in a bowl. Blanch the rice noodles in the broth, then transfer them to a bowl. Add the blanched pork bones to a pot and simmer them over low heat until tender. Next, add the white radish slices. Once the bones and radishes are soft, season the broth to taste and turn off the heat. Skim the foam frequently during cooking to keep the broth clear. Place the blanched rice noodles into a bowl, add tenderloin slices, shrimp, liver, quail eggs, and stir-fried ground pork on top. Garnish with chives, scallions, and chopped celery, then pour the noodle broth over the bowl.
