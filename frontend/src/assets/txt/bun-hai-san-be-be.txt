Ingredients for Bun Be Be (Vietnamese Vermicelli with Mantis Shrimp):
500g mantis shrimp (be be)
1kg fresh rice vermicelli (bun)
4 pieces of soft tofu
4 tomatoes
Ginger, green onions, shallots, cilantro
Fresh herbs: lettuce, Vietnamese coriander, water spinach
Seasonings: salt, sugar, seasoning powder, cooking oil
Tools: bowl, pot, strainer

Instructions:
Step 1: Prepare the Mantis Shrimp
Rinse the mantis shrimp thoroughly. In a pot, add the shrimp with 1 crushed shallot and a few slices of ginger, then boil for about 5 minutes. Once cooked, remove, let cool, and peel off the shells.

Step 2: Prepare Other Ingredients
Cut the tofu into small cubes and fry until golden and crispy. Rinse the tomatoes and cut them into wedges. Peel and mince the shallots. Rinse and finely chop the green onions and cilantro. Clean the lettuce, herbs, and water spinach to serve as accompaniments.

Step 3: Cook the Broth
Blend the shrimp shells and heads with 600ml water, then strain to extract the flavorful broth. Heat a pot with 1 tablespoon of oil, add the minced shallots and prepared tomatoes, and sauté for about 5 minutes. Pour the shrimp broth into the pot and season with 1 tablespoon of seasoning powder, ½ tablespoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of fish sauce. Let it simmer for around 15 minutes, then turn off the heat.
Place a portion of vermicelli into a bowl, arrange the mantis shrimp, fried tofu, and fresh herbs on top. Garnish with chopped green onions and cilantro, then ladle the broth over everything and enjoy!
