Ingredients for Bun Moc (Vietnamese Pork Meatball Noodle Soup):
400g pork spare ribs
300g pork bone
50g pork paste
2-3 dried wood ear mushrooms
Fresh rice vermicelli (bun)
Fried shallots
2 shallots
Green onions, cilantro
Salt, seasoning powder, pepper, cooking oil

Instructions:
Step 1: Prepare the Broth
Blanch the pork bones and spare ribs briefly to remove impurities. Rinse, then place the pork bones in 1.2 liters of water, seasoning with 2 teaspoons of seasoning powder and 1 teaspoon of salt. Simmer to extract the flavors. While the broth is simmering, marinate the pork spare ribs with 1/3 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon seasoning powder, and 1 teaspoon pepper, and set aside for 15 minutes.

Step 2: Make the Meatballs
Soak the wood ear mushrooms in warm water until soft, then finely chop. Combine the chopped mushrooms with the pork paste, mixing well, and shape into small, round meatballs.

Step 3: Cook the Soup
Heat a pan with some oil, add minced shallots, and saut√© until fragrant. Add the marinated pork spare ribs and stir-fry briefly. Add the ribs to the bone broth and bring it back to a boil. Drop the meatballs into the soup, and once they float to the surface, they are fully cooked.

Step 4: Serve
Briefly blanch the fresh vermicelli in hot water, then place it in a bowl. Ladle the broth, meatballs, and ribs over the vermicelli. Garnish with chopped green onions, cilantro, and fried shallots. A sprinkle of pepper on top will make it extra delicious. Enjoy!
