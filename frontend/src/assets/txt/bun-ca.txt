Instructions for making Bún Cá Kiên Giang:

Step 1: Prepare the ingredients
After purchasing the snakehead fish, clean it thoroughly and remove all the internal organs. Use salt to rub both the inside and outside of the fish to eliminate its fishy smell. Next, remove the bones, skin the fish, and cut it into bite-sized pieces.
Similarly, to remove the fishy smell from the shrimp, soak them in a diluted saltwater solution for about 3 - 5 minutes, then rinse with clean water. After that, remove the heads, peel the shells, and remove the dark vein on the back of the shrimp.
Pick out the damaged leaves of the Vietnamese coriander, chives, and lettuce, wash them thoroughly, and let them drain.
For the other ingredients, peel (if necessary), wash, and prepare as follows: Cut the onion into wedges; thinly slice the shallots; chop the green onion and chili; mince the garlic.
Sauté the garlic and shallots until fragrant.

Step 2: Marinate the fish and shrimp
Place the snakehead fish in a bowl and season it with 1 teaspoon of salt for about 15 minutes.
For the shrimp, use a pestle to lightly pound them, then add 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and shallots, 1 teaspoon of seasoning powder, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and ⅓ teaspoon of ground pepper. Mix well and marinate for another 15 minutes.

Step 3: Sauté the shrimp
In a pot, add about 2 tablespoons of fried annatto oil. Once the oil is hot, add the shrimp and stir-fry. When the shrimp is nearly cooked, add 2 egg yolks and continue to sauté until the shrimp is fully cooked.

Step 4: Make the broth
Pour about 2 liters of water into a pot, cover, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the onion wedges to enhance the broth's sweetness.
Next, add the snakehead fish, season with 1 tablespoon of seasoning powder, 2 teaspoons of salt, 25g of rock sugar, and a bit of ground pepper. Cook until the fish is done.

Step 5: Arrange the dish
Place the lettuce, chives, Vietnamese coriander, and rice noodles in a bowl. Then add the fish and shrimp on top, ladle the broth over, and garnish with green onions, chili, and a slice of lemon to complete the dish.
