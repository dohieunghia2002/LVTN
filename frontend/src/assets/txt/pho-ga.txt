Ingredients:
1 local hen (1.4 - 1.5 kg)
1 onion
2 small pieces of ginger
4-5 shallots
1 - 1.2 kg fresh pho (or dried pho cooked according to instructions)
Accompaniments: coriander, green onions, lime leaves, bean sprouts
Seasonings: fish sauce, salt, seasoning powder, pepper, dry coriander seeds

Instructions:
1. Prepare the Ingredients: Clean the onion and shallots, roast the ginger until fragrant. Wash the coriander (keep the roots to add flavor to the broth), clean the green onions (split the white parts lengthwise, chop the green parts), and thinly slice the lime leaves.

2. Prepare the Chicken: Clean the hen, rub with salt and lime, and rinse. Remove the fat from the hen's belly, pan-fry it to render the fat, and mix it with a little turmeric to brush over the hen after boiling for a nice golden color.

3. Boil the Chicken: Place the hen in a thick-bottomed pot, cover it with water (at least 2/3 of the hen), add 2-3 smashed shallots, 1 piece of ginger, and 1 tablespoon of salt. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a medium simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover, and let the hen steep for 25-30 minutes, depending on the size.

4. Filter and Slice the Chicken: Once cooked, remove the hen and soak it in hot water to cool down slightly with some ice to keep the skin crispy. After cooling, remove and pat dry, then brush the turmeric fat over it for an appealing golden color. Slice the meat thinly across the grain while keeping the skin for presentation. You can shred the meat if you prefer.

5. Make the Broth: Place the leftover chicken bones into a pot to simmer for a richer broth. Add the roasted onion, roasted ginger, and toasted coriander seeds, and simmer over low heat, skimming off any foam. Leave the lid partially open to help clarify the broth. After 2 hours, remove the bones, onion, ginger, and coriander seeds. Season with fish sauce, salt, and seasoning powder to taste. If you don't have coriander seeds, use the cleaned roots of the coriander towards the end of cooking for flavor.

6. Serve and Enjoy: Blanch the pho noodles and place them in each bowl. Add the sliced chicken, blanched bean sprouts, sliced shallots, chopped green onions, and coriander. Ladle hot broth over the top, sprinkle with thinly sliced lime leaves, and enjoy your delicious pho!
