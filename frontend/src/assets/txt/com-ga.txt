Ingredients for Chicken Rice:
1 whole cleaned chicken
3 cups sticky rice
3 teaspoons turmeric powder
1 onion
1 large ginger root
5 lemongrass stalks
For salad: 1 small cabbage, 4-10 shallots, Vietnamese coriander (rau rÄƒm)
For fish sauce: 100g ginger, 4 garlic cloves, 2 red chilies
Additional seasonings: lime, sugar, seasoning powder, fish sauce

Instructions for Chicken Rice:
1. Prepare Ingredients: Rinse the chicken and pat dry. To give the chicken skin a nice yellow color, mix 3 teaspoons turmeric powder with 1 teaspoon seasoning powder and rub evenly over the chicken. Let marinate for 15 minutes. Grill the onion, large ginger, and lemongrass until fragrant, either in an oven or on a stove, then cut into pieces to add to the chicken broth. Slice the cabbage into thin strips, thinly slice shallots, and chop Vietnamese coriander for the salad. Finely chop ginger, garlic, and chili for the fish sauce.

2. Boil the Chicken: Fill a pot with 1 liter of water, add the onion, ginger, lemongrass, and a pinch of salt, and bring to a simmer. Place the marinated chicken into the pot, cover, and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes until tender. For crispy chicken skin, immediately transfer the cooked chicken into an ice bath to cool. Once cool, cut into pieces for serving; separate the tender meat for rice, and shred tougher parts.

3. Prepare Salad: While waiting for the chicken to cook, make the salad by combining the cabbage, shallots, and Vietnamese coriander in a bowl. Add 4 teaspoons of sugar and 2 lime slices, then mix well.

4. Cook the Rice: To achieve a beautiful yellow color and rich flavor, use the chicken broth for cooking the rice. Strain the broth to remove the onion, ginger, and lemongrass. Skim off excess fat to keep the rice light and glossy. Rinse 3 cups of sticky rice once or twice to retain nutrients, then add 3 cups of chicken broth and cook with a 1:1 ratio to get soft, non-mushy rice.

5. Prepare the Soup: Use the remaining broth to make a simple soup with any vegetables on hand. Dice carrots and daikon, add to the pot, bring to a boil, season to taste, and turn off the heat.

6. Make Fish Sauce: Combine minced garlic, chili, and ginger with 115g sugar, 150ml water, 75ml fish sauce, and 2 lime slices in a bowl. Stir until the sugar dissolves.

7. Final Plating: Serve the cooked rice on a plate, arrange the chicken pieces and shredded chicken alongside, and add the cabbage salad. Dip the chicken in fish sauce, and enjoy the fragrant rice with a bit of salad for a delicious homemade meal! The tender chicken, savory rice, and crunchy, tangy cabbage will leave you craving more.
