How to make Bun Bo Hue:
1. First, wash the ginger and lemongrass thoroughly, then lightly crush them. Clean the pork leg and chop it into smaller pieces. You can also tie up the beef shank with twine to help keep it tender and prevent it from shrinking.
2. Blanch the pork leg, beef shank, bones, brisket, and tendon. Skim off any foam during this step to keep the broth clear and visually appealing.
3. Marinate the meat by mixing it with sugar, salt, MSG, minced shallots, minced garlic, and minced lemongrass (adjust the amounts to taste). Combine everything well and let it absorb the flavors.
4. After marinating, place the meat and bones in a pressure cooker and simmer thoroughly. When simmering, allow it to boil for about 5 minutes, then lower the heat and continue simmering for around 20 minutes. Remove the beef shank and brisket, and immerse them in cold water to make the meat firmer and more compact.
5. This step is crucial for creating a flavorful broth. Combine the beef and bone broth into a large pot, then add more water and bring it to a boil. Add seasonings like fried shallots, minced lemongrass, and minced garlic, adjusting to your taste. A tip for achieving authentic flavor: dilute the shrimp paste with water, strain, and add it to the broth. Finally, add this mixture to the simmering broth.
6. For the final step, arrange your bowl beautifully and enjoy your creation!
