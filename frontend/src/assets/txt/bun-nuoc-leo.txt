Instructions for Making Vietnamese Fermented Fish Noodle Soup:
1. Prepare Ingredients: First, cut the snakehead fish, shrimp, and roasted pork into bite-sized pieces. Then, bring a pot of water with 1 tablespoon of salt to a boil, and quickly blanch the fish and shrimp for about 2 minutes.
2. Mix Seasonings for the Broth: Cut the galangal into pieces about 3–4 cm long and crush them. In a bowl, combine 5g chopped chili, 40g chopped lemongrass, 20g chopped shallots, and 50g cooking oil, and mix well. Heat a pan and add this mixture, sautéing until fragrant. In another bowl, combine 5g salt, 14g seasoning powder, 70g rock sugar, 5g annatto oil, 10g chili satay, and 80g fish sauce, mixing well. This mixture will be the broth seasoning.
3. Cook the Broth: In a blender, blend 200g of fermented linh fish, 200g of fermented sạc fish, and 200ml of water until smooth. Pour this fish mixture into a pot with 2 liters of water, bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let settle. When the mixture has settled (clear water on top, cloudy water below), carefully pour the clear broth into another pot. Add 1 liter of water, the sautéed mixture, the seasoning mixture (salt, seasoning powder, etc.), and 100g galangal to the pot. Place it back on the stove and bring to a boil. Now the broth is ready.
4. Serving: To serve, place noodles in a bowl, arrange shrimp, roasted pork, and assorted herbs on top, then ladle the broth over to enjoy immediately.
