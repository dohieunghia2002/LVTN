Ingredients for Beef Pho:
1.5 kg beef bones
200g beef fillet
500g beef balls
Pho noodles
Shallots, green onions, onion
Lemon, ginger
Cloves, star anise, cardamom, cinnamon, or pho spice mix
Rock sugar, coarse salt, monosodium glutamate (MSG)

Instructions for Making Beef Pho:
1. Prepare the Ingredients: Clean the beef bones thoroughly. Soak them in water for about 30 minutes, adding some coarse salt mixed with lemon to reduce the odor. Then, blanch the bones in boiling water and rinse them again. After washing, roast the onion over low heat until fragrant. Next, clean the beef fillet and slice it thinly for serving on top of the pho. Chop the green onions finely.

2. Make the Broth: Place the bones in a pot and add 1 liter of water, 1 tablespoon of salt, and the roasted onion. Start simmering the mixture; using a pressure cooker will speed up the process. After simmering the bones for about 30 minutes, add 1.5 liters of water. Next, add the beef balls along with the cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and star anise. Cook over medium heat without covering the pot, skimming off the foam regularly to keep the broth clear and fragrant. After 30 minutes, remove the beef bones and spices. Season the broth with 1 tablespoon of coarse salt, 1 tablespoon of rock sugar, and 1 tablespoon of MSG, stirring well to dissolve the seasonings.

3. Serving: Place a portion of pho noodles in a bowl. Arrange the sliced beef fillet on top and sprinkle with chopped green onions. Pour the hot broth over the noodles, and itâ€™s ready for you to enjoy!
