Ingredients:
600g pork shoulder or pork belly
600g pork bones for broth (optional)
4 shallots
4 garlic cloves
Seasonings: Salt, five-spice powder, soy sauce, sugar, seasoning powder
Cooking oil, annatto oil
Hoi An Cao Lau noodles (noodle strands and square crispy pieces)
Hoi An chili sauce, green bird’s eye chili
Accompanying herbs: Basil, bean sprouts, mustard greens, chili, lime, etc.

Instructions:
1. Preparation: Choose pork shoulder or belly based on your taste. Pick fresh pork with a slight pink hue, firm texture, and good elasticity. Cut the pork lengthwise along the grain, as this will make it easier to slice across the grain after cooking for a more attractive presentation. Hoi An-style char siu marinade has its unique flavor compared to Chinese char siu. Crush shallots and garlic to extract their juices for quick marinating, ensuring they don’t burn during frying. Keep the solids for later frying. For the marinade, add soy sauce, sugar, five-spice powder, salt, seasoning powder, pepper, chili powder, and a touch of annatto oil for color. Wash and drain the herbs (basil, bean sprouts, mustard greens, lettuce).

2. Marinating: In a large bowl, marinate the pork with 1 packet of five-spice powder (5g), 4 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1.5 tablespoons of sugar, 1 tablespoon of annatto oil, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning powder, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and chili powder if desired. Mix well and marinate for at least 2-3 hours. For best results, cover and refrigerate overnight for enhanced flavor.

3. Cooking: Heat oil in a pan, then place the marinated pork in and sear both sides until golden. Turn occasionally to prevent burning, then remove and set aside. Using the same oil, sauté the reserved garlic and shallot solids until fragrant. Add the pork back along with the marinade. Pour in pork broth (or water) to cover the meat, adjust seasoning with additional soy sauce and sugar if needed, bring to a boil, and then simmer gently. After 10-15 minutes, turn the pork to ensure even coloring. After 40-50 minutes, skim off a portion of the sauce to use for drizzling over the noodles. Continue simmering the pork until tender and the sauce has thickened to a rich brown. Turn off the heat, let the pork cool, then slice thinly.

4. Assembly: Prepare the Cao Lau noodles by either blanching or steaming fresh noodles, or soaking dried noodles for 1-2 hours before blanching in boiling water. Drizzle with a bit of oil to prevent sticking. In a bowl, layer with blanched bean sprouts, Cao Lau noodles, and char siu pork slices. Drizzle the reserved sauce over the noodles. Garnish with crispy squares, lime, Hoi An chili sauce, fresh herbs, and green bird’s eye chili for the authentic flavor. Enjoy!
